  <h1>About Abba’s Most Loved</h1>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
    <strong>Abba’s Most Loved</strong> is more than a name — it is a cry, a conviction, and a calling.  
    It is a Spirit-breathed movement birthed out of the secret place, dedicated to awakening a distracted generation, restoring intimacy with the Father, and sounding the trumpet of truth in a time of spiritual slumber.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
    We are not a denomination, not a church, and not a ministry in the conventional sense.  
    We are a yielded vessel in God's hands — a digital altar where burning messages, divine teachings, prayer burdens, and prophetic declarations confront compromise, expose deception, and rekindle passion for Jesus.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
    Our focus is singular: <strong>to glorify Jesus</strong>, make His voice known, and raise end-time soldiers who will not bow to culture or blend with darkness.  
    This platform serves as a training ground for spiritual discernment, sound doctrine, and prophetic evangelism.  
    It is a place where the forgotten remember who they are, and the broken are healed by the truth of God's Word.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
    Whether you found us by accident or by divine leading — welcome.  
    We believe you were drawn here by the Spirit, and this is not just a website you stumbled upon — it is an encounter, a revival hub, and a place of destiny realignment.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
    You are loved. You are chosen. You are not forgotten.  
    And as you journey with us, may the voice of Abba thunder louder in your spirit.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center;">
    Welcome to Abba's Most Loved —  
    <em>Where brokenness meets fire, and purpose is born again.</em>
